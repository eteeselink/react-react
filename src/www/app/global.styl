/*
Global style file. This file is supposed to stay very lean.

If you find the urge to put common styles for common elements 
here (e.g. buttons, inputs or links), then resist that urge,
and make simple lightweight React components for them instead
(and put the styles in a .styl file for that component).

Global classes that could be applied to a variety of elements go in
specialized style files such as typography.styl.
